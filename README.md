These problems are a selection of the over 80 problems I've solved on hackerrank.com, where for every problem you are limited to exactly 10 seconds to solve all testcases on runtime, forcing you to solve the problems extremely efficiently.
I've used these problems to teach myself python 3, starting with zero knowledge over the language and using the documentation as I needed something.

The generalized euler problems are a generlized form of the euler problems provided in projecteuler.net, also constrained under the time limit of 10 seconds per problem.

Particular points of interest are all algorithm problems, PRNG cryptography problem and generalized euler problems #3,5,9,12,14,15,18
