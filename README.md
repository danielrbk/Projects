These problems are a selection of the many problems I've solved on hackerrank.com, where for every problem you are limited to exactly 10 seconds to solve all testcases on runtime, forcing you to solve the problems as efficiently as possible.
Every problem is documented, explaining my thought process and choice of algorithm.

I've used these problems to teach myself python 3.

The generalized euler problems are a generlized form of the euler problems provided in projecteuler.net, also constrained under the time limit of 10 seconds per problem runttime.

Particular points of interest are all algorithm problems, PRNG cryptography problem and generalized euler problems #3,5,9,12,14,15,18
